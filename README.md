# AliasGame (Demo)
### Team game made by Team

ALIAS is a word game that you play in teams. In ALIAS you have to say things in “other words”.  
The idea is to explain words using synonyms, opposites or clues so that your team mates guess as many words from the card as possible before the timer runs out. 

**Stack**: Swift, UI code, UIKit, UIKit animation, MVC, Delegate, JSON, URL, IOS Human Guidelines.

**Result**:
- Setting the number of teams
- Possibility to add your own team name
- Implemented the difficulty choice of the game
- Storing data for each difficulty level (UI, words) in a .json file
- Timer to report the time runs out
- Ranking of the teams after each round
- Added sounds (buttons, alerts, timer) to enhance the effect of user interaction with the app 
- Used custom navgation bar and alerts
- Transferring data between screens with delegate and closures
- Added animation
